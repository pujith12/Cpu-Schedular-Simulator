# 🧠 CPU Scheduler Simulator

A web-based CPU Scheduling Simulator built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It helps visualize and understand various CPU scheduling algorithms using Gantt charts and performance metrics like waiting time and turnaround time.

---
## 🎯 Purpose of the Project

This simulator is designed to help:

- 📚 Students understand CPU scheduling visually
- 👨‍🏫 Teachers demonstrate algorithms interactively
- 💻 Developers prototype scheduling logic
- 📊 Users compare the efficiency of different algorithms

---

## 🚀 Features

- 📋 Add custom processes with arrival time, burst time, and priority
- 🔄 Simulate the following scheduling algorithms:
  - FCFS (First Come First Serve)
  - SJF (Shortest Job First - Non-Preemptive)
  - Priority Scheduling (Non-Preemptive)
  - Round Robin (with configurable quantum)
- 📊 Dynamic **Gantt chart** visualization
- ⏱️ Calculates and displays:
  - Average Waiting Time (WT)
  - Average Turnaround Time (TAT)
- 🎨 Clean UI with smooth transitions and effects.
